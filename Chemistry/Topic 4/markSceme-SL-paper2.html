<p>This question focused on atomic structure and metals was very accessible. Many students could correctly state relative mass and charge of the subatomic particles but it was disappointing to see the number of students who could not. Units were not penalized which meant that more students gained marks than would otherwise have been the case. Many students could calculate the protons and neutrons in the copper isotope but few could explain how the physical properties would vary (mass is not a property) and few could clearly explain why the chemical properties were identical. Explanations were often far too vague. Two properties of copper were asked for in and many could give one, again answers were often very vague, such as &ldquo;it conducts&rdquo; without specifying what it was conducting.</p>

(b) was essentially a &ldquo;dead&rdquo; mark and perhaps was out of place on a SL paper. Many students seemed to be aware of the difference between strong and weak acids, but few could use this to answer (c)(i), and many were unable to write an equation for its reaction in water. The more able candidates realised that acids would affect the position of the equilibrium and a number recognized that the toxic gas chlorine would be a product. Many students identified hydrogen bonding from the &ndash;OH group as being the reason for the solubility of HOCl. Most were able to give the Lewis (electron dot) structure of chloric(I) acid, but few were able to give a detailed explanation of its bond angle, with only a minority referring to electron domains. In part (d) very few students could write, or combine, appropriate half equations, even though the reactants and products were given, though many could deduce the oxidation numbers of the species in the equations.

<p class="p1">This was the most popular question answered in Section B.</p>
<p class="p2">The definition of oxidation and reduction, deducing oxidation numbers (although some forgot the + sign) and distinguishing between an oxidizing and reducing agent was answered very well by a majority of the candidates. However, a surprising number of candidates were unable to balance the redox equation or identify the correct oxidizing and reducing agents in the given reaction.</p>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p class="p1">In part (b), most candidates defined an acid according to the Br&oslash;nsted&ndash;Lowry and Lewis theories and identify the shorter bond in the Lewis structure given of \({\text{HN}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\). Many candidates were able to deduce the approximate value of the H<span class="s1">―</span>O―N bond angle, however, some candidates were unable to explain in terms of the greater space occupied by the non-bonding electron pairs compared to the bonding electron pairs. Distinguishing between strong and weak acid in terms of their dissociation in aqueous solution was handled very well. The Lewis structure and shape of ammonia was done correctly by most candidates. However, the weaker candidates stated triangular planar instead of triangular pyramidal and that the molecule has no symmetry instead of unsymmetrical distribution of charge giving rise to a net dipole moment. The change in concentration with the change in pH was done well while an overwhelming number of candidates did not write the correct formula of ammonium sulphate.</p>

<p>Generally candidates found some elements of this question quite challenging but there were accessible marks of even the weakest candidates. The majority of students were able to determine the molar mass of ethanoic acid but some struggled to calculate the mass from the volume. Most candidates were able to identify the role of hydrochloric acid as a catalyst but some struggled to identify the liquid whose volume had the greatest uncertainty. Most candidates were able to calculate the absolute uncertainty of the titre but some lost a mark by omitting the \( + \)/\( - \) sign. Candidates did not identify the first titre as incongruent and simply averaged the three values which perhaps suggests limited experimental experience. Most students could determine an equilibrium constant expression, but many did not answer the question in (g) and did not suggest how the equilibrium could be established experimentally with many referring to the equal rate of the forward and backward reaction. Many candidates were aware of Le Chatelier effects on the position of equilibrium, but a significant number failed to use this information to answer the question asked and could not explain the small effect of temperature changes. Whilst most students managed to identify the ester as the component of the mixture that was insoluble in water, many did not refer to its inability to form strong hydrogen bonds to water which was necessary for the mark. Quite a number of students came up with a valid reason why water would not be a suitable though some students appeared to have overlooked that the question asked for &ldquo;one other reason&rdquo; than that implied in (j).</p>

Most candidates were able to identify the role of hydrochloric acid as a catalyst but some struggled to identify the liquid whose volume had the greatest uncertainty.

Candidates did not identify the first titre as incongruent and simply averaged the three values which perhaps suggests limited experimental experience.

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>Probably the least popular option. The drawing of the diagram of chloromethane was generally excellent, as was the prediction/recall of the shape and bond angle. With the reasons for polarity, the concept of bond polarity was well understood, but the idea of asymmetry resulting in a dipole was less clearly appreciated. The construction of the chemical equation was disappointing, as was the description of the three types of bonding, very often missing the important point, in that they are attractions. With the calculation of volume of hydrogen, it was quite rare to get a fully correct answer. The biggest error was to use an incorrect value for the number of moles of hydrogen in the equation \(pV = nRT\), by failing to halve the moles of hydrogen. The use of \(pV = nRT\) also caused problems with units. The acid base nature of oxides of a period were generally well known. In contrast, the construction or recall of correct chemical equations for the reaction with water was a weakness.</p>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>This was by far the most popular question. As before the definition was poorly done and many students defined electronegativity as just attraction for electrons or energy change in gaining an electron. However, many could at least half explain why the atomic radius decreased. In (c) some students could write a correct equation for the addition of sodium oxide to water but very few could correctly write an equation for phosphorous(V) oxide with water, following on few could then correctly state a sensible pH for the solutions formed. Suggesting methods to distinguish between strong and weak acids was reasonably well answered but many student lost marks for the imprecision in their answers. Stating "see if it conducts" and "add pH paper" were common answers without predictions of the expected results. Identification of \({\text{B}}{{\text{F}}_{\text{3}}}\) as a Lewis acid was not always explained well as students mixed up proton donation and electron pair donation. In (f) the description of the bonding and structure of sodium chloride was not well done, although there were a few strong candidates who had little problems with this question. Most candidates could correctly state the ionic formulae though. The last part of this question asked for a Lewis structure of \({\text{PC}}{{\text{l}}_{\text{3}}}\) and most did this well, although some forgot the lone pairs on the chlorine atoms. Most could then correctly state a bond angle although there were a number of candidates who stated 120&deg;. Few candidates could explain why the molecule was polar.</p>

<p class="p1">The main G2 comments on this question related to the inclusion of organic chemistry in Section A. It should be noted that ANY Topic can be asked in Section A of P2, and there is no set-formula in relation to question setting. Organic chemistry is an integral part of the IB SL Chemistry programme, and is covered in Topic 10 of the guide (12 hours in total). Hence, candidates should be adequately prepared for questions on this topic, even in Section A. In 3(a), the Lewis structure of chlorethene was generally drawn correctly, though the weaker candidates often omitted the lone pairs on the chlorine. The bond angle was usually predicted, although right angles and 109.5&deg;<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>were often given. Even some of the better candidates explained their choice of bond angle, based on the fact that the double bond occupies more space causing the HCCl bond angle to drop less than 120&deg;.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.i.</div>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>In Part (a) most candidates gained full marks, with the most common error being a failure to quote the answer to the precision specified, but the explanations of deflection, and more particularly detection, in the mass spectrometer were weak. The prediction of relative atomic radii of the isotopes, something that required the application of reason rather than recall, also proved much more challenging. Part (b) revealed that many candidates have a very weak understanding of the metallic bond with many thinking the bonding was ionic.</p>
<p>Even when they knew about a cation lattice and delocalized electrons, a mark was frequently dropped by failing to specify that the attraction between them was electrostatic. Most candidates wrote the correct equation in Part (c), but it is still disturbing that some students at this level cannot write even the most straightforward chemical equation. In Part (d) many students proved capable of carrying out routine stoichiometric calculations to identify the limiting reactant and use the result to find the mass of the product.</p>
<p>Even if the final result was incorrect quite frequently students gained some credit through the application of ECF. Only the better candidates could write an equation for the neutralisation of phosphoric(V) acid and even the routine derivation of a conjugate base from the formula of the acid proved difficult for many. In Part (e) most students could manage the correct Lewis structure, though some lost the mark through omitting the charge. Many candidates also scored well on the shape of the ion and the polarity of the P-H bond.</p>

<p>Question 5 was a popular choice in Section B. There were many candidates who stated a correct equation for the reaction of sodium with water, but many gave \({\text{N}}{{\text{a}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}\) instead of NaOH as a product in (a)(i). Candidates could frequently state one observation of this reaction in (a)(ii) and most candidates correctly predicted relative reaction rates for lithium, sodium and potassium with water in (a)(iii). Question (b)(i) required candidates to predict changes which may be observed when chlorine gas is bubbled through separate solutions of aqueous bromine and potassium bromide. Very few candidates correctly predicted both of the changes observed and there was some confusion between observations and statements of the expected reactions. In (b)(ii) many candidates gave the complete equation between chlorine and bromide ions and not the half-equations as requested. Part (c) referred to the periodicity of boiling points of hydrogen halides. Most candidates referred to the hydrogen bonding between HF molecules as the reason for the high boiling point of HF in (c)(i) although some said that the bond in H&ndash;F is a hydrogen bond and so hard to break, indicating a lack of understanding of what is happening on a molecular level when boiling occurs. Many had difficulties explaining the trend of the boiling points of the hydrogen halides, often referring to the elements themselves in (c)(ii). Only the better candidates referred to the strength of van der Waals&rsquo; forces increasing with increasing electrons or molecular mass. In part (d) very few candidates could explain why the ionic radius of a chloride ion is greater than the atomic radius of a chlorine atom, forgetting the extra repulsion between the electrons. Some answered in terms of the nuclear charge. Many simply stated that non-metal ions are larger than the non-metal atom, suggesting that the command terms are not well understood. Many candidates did not mention that \({\text{N}}{{\text{a}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}\) has an ionic bond and \({\text{S}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}\) a covalent one in (e)(i) and many candidates also had problems explaining why \({\text{N}}{{\text{a}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}\) conducts electricity when molten, referring to free moving electrons instead of ions. A surprising number of candidates seemed to think that as \({\text{N}}{{\text{a}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}\) melts, the sodium reverts to its metallic structure and hence is an electrical conductor. Several others referred to electrons being able to move through the ions which were no longer fixed in position. Several candidates could not state the acid-base nature of \({\text{N}}{{\text{a}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}\) and \({\text{S}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}\), although many could state their equations with water in (e)(iii). Many candidates correctly identified a source of \({\text{S}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}\) in (e)(iv) and those who did not often had a vague answer such as engine or factory. Most candidates correctly named acid rain as the environmental effect of sulfur trioxide pollution. Some respondents felt that this was beyond the scope of the syllabus but there is clear reference to these effects in 3.3.2 and 8.3.1.</p>

A surprising number of candidates seemed to think that as \({\text{N}}{{\text{a}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}\) melts, the sodium reverts to its metallic structure and hence is an electrical conductor. Several others referred to electrons being able to move through the ions which were no longer fixed in position. Several candidates could not state the acid-base nature of \({\text{N}}{{\text{a}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}\) and \({\text{S}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}\), although many could state their equations with water in (e)(iii). Many candidates correctly identified a source of \({\text{S}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}\) in (e)(iv) and those who did not often had a vague answer such as engine or factory. Most candidates correctly named acid rain as the environmental effect of sulfur trioxide pollution. Some respondents felt that this was beyond the scope of the syllabus but there is clear reference to these effects in 3.3.2 and 8.3.1.</p>

<p>Many candidates could sketch correct curves in (a)(i), though many did not realize that the same final volume of hydrogen is formed. Lines were generally poorly drawn with several lines for one curve, and curve I often did not join smoothly with the given curve, but dropped near the end or overshot the final volume and then fell back down. Candidates are advised to draw graphs in pencil first. In (a)(ii), very few students indicated that because the mass of hydrogen is very small it is better to measure reaction rate using gas volume; most indicated that it is not precise because the mass of a mixture is measured. It seems that very few candidates are aware that measuring loss of mass per unit time is a valid tool for determining the rate of a reaction when \({\text{C}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\) is produced. The moles of magnesium sulfate were mostly calculated correctly in (b)(i), but in (b)(ii) most candidates had problems calculating the enthalpy change, working with the mass of magnesium sulfate instead of water or solution and not giving the enthalpy change a negative sign. Several candidates only found the temperature change and called this the enthalpy change, or found the energy change and ignored the number of moles. Few candidates correctly applied Hess&rsquo;s law in (c)(i). Some respondents felt that this was not on the SL course, but it is clearly stated in 5.3.1. Some candidates had no idea how to calculate the percentage difference in (c)(ii) and several left this blank despite a value being given for the experimental results for candidates to use if they had not found a value themselves. Quite a few others determined the percentage difference correctly. In (d) most candidates stated heat loss to the surroundings as an error, mentioning further irrelevant errors. Only the better candidates also referred to the partial hydration of the anhydrous salt. The equation for the reaction between sulfuric acid and magnesium carbonate was generally done well in (e)(i) but \({{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{C}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}\) was frequently (incorrectly) given as a product. A few candidates did not know the formulas for sulfuric acid and magnesium carbonate. Very few candidates could give a correct Lewis structure for the carbonate ion in (ii). Some almost scored but failed to include brackets and charge. Some decided that the carbonate ion was a synonym for carbon dioxide and drew that. The formula for the carbonate ion should be known (assessment statement 4.1.7) and only one Lewis structure was required so students did not need to know about resonance structures. Shape and bond angle were also done poorly but there were a few candidates who knew the shape and bond angle of the carbonate ion even though they couldn&rsquo;t draw the Lewis structure.</p>

<p class="p1">This was the second most popular question answered in Section B. This question was focussed on organic chemistry and attempted by many candidates.</p>
<p class="p1">Most candidates were able to draw the correct structure of 2-methylbut-2-ene in part (a). In part (b), water and sulfuric acid were stated correctly as the reagents. In part (c), most candidates knew that tertiary alcohols do not react. In part (d), the most common mistake was some candidates thinking that the hydroxyl group in an alcohol was a hydrogen bond. Some other candidates could not write that the alcohol forms hydrogen bonds with water. In part (e), many candidates got \({{\text{S}}_{\text{N}}}{\text{1}}\), though an odd few candidates identified the mechanism as \({{\text{S}}_{\text{N}}}{\text{2}}\). In part (e) (ii), the mechanisms proved a problem for several candidates. The use of curly arrows in reaction mechanisms continues to be poorly understood, the arrow often pointing in the wrong direction. Candidates must take care to accurately draw the position of the curly arrows illustrating the movement of electrons. Some candidates forgot to include the lone pair for the curly arrow going from the lone pair on O to \({{\text{C}}^ + }\). Some candidates had the lone pair incorrectly located on the H and others had the curly arrow going to an atom instead of between the O and the \({{\text{C}}^ + }\). Part (iii) was well answered.</p>
<p class="p1">Part (f) proved challenging for candidates and very few referred to chlorines isotopes. In addition, the majority of candidates did not state that the same rate could be applied as the isotopes have the same chemical properties. In part (g), many candidates scored three out of five marks. Some candidates forgot to state that the sample is converted to the gaseous state for the vaporization stage. Many candidates although knew about detection but only few stated that the ions hit the counter and an electrical signal is generated.</p>

In 7ci, most students scored at least one mark, but lost the second. There was a lack of awareness of the importance of the system being aqueous in the conversion to the alcohol and a fully correct answer was very rare, as was the identification of the functional group. In the volatility question, most were aware of hydrogen bonding, but the fact that C also has greater other forces due to its greater mass was not present in most answers. The gaseous mark was often present, but the averaging over a range of compounds was not.

<p>This beginning of this question to state the uncertainty and to calculate the average volume added were well done and most students could also calculate the number of moles added. However, many candidates began to lose marks from this point onwards. Some could identify the ratio and correctly state the moles of ethanedioic acid, but fewer realized they needed to multiply 10 to get back to the original solution. The next step to calculate the \({M_{\text{r}}}\) was only correctly completed by a handful of students. Those that were correct with the molar mass always could calculate the moles of water, many students just guessed an answer though.</p>
<p>The intermolecular force was correctly described as hydrogen bonding, however there were some instances when it seemed unclear whether students realized this was between molecules and instead they seemed to suggest it was a bond between hydrogen and oxygen in the molecule. Some candidates could correctly draw the Lewis structure but a number of those lost marks for omitting the lone pairs on oxygen.</p>

<p class="p1">Most knew the meaning of the symbols S<sub><span class="s1">N</span></sub>2, however, a few did not correctly state the meaning of the 2. The mechanism caused some problems and some of the common errors here were drawing the curly arrow from the H; forgetting to include any curly arrow to show Br leaving; writing the partial bond from the nucleophile as OH---C; or missing the negative charge from the transition state. Unfortunately, most candidates had a combination of these errors. Also, in most cases the partial bonds were drawn at angles less than 180 degrees which, although not penalised, is totally incorrect as attack by the nucleophile must be on the opposite side to the halogen leaving.</p>

<p class="p1">Those who were relying on ECF marks here often predicted the wrong isomer or found it very difficult to explain their prediction.

<p class="p1">This was a popular question and was answered quite successfully. The Lewis structure for ethene was given correctly by the great majority of the candidates, but that of hydrazine by only about half of them. Incorrect answers had double bonds appearing between the 2 nitrogen atoms and lone pairs on nitrogen atoms not shown. Those who could draw the correct structure in (i) gave the correct bond angle, but the explanation was not given correctly by many. Only very few scored the five marks as many failed to mention the extra repulsion of the lone pair.</p>

<div class="question">
<p class="p1">There were several G2 comments on this question, all of which claimed that the question was difficult for SL candidates especially as a three-step reaction process was involved. Certainly some of the weaker candidates struggled with this question, but with the application of ECF marks, most candidates should have been able to score the majority of marks in the question. What was more worrying was the large number of candidates who scored zero or close to zero marks on Q.1, which meant they had little idea of a titration from their exposure to laboratory work in the programme as a whole.</p>
<p class="p1">In (a) (i), most candidates showed a reasonable understanding of oxidation numbers, but relatively few scored full marks as they did not read the question which asked explicitly for the change in oxidation numbers. A number also incorrectly wrote 5+ going to 4+ instead of +5 going to +4 i.e. they mixed up charges with oxidation numbers. In the oxidizing agent question in part (ii), the most common mistake was candidates writing nitrogen, instead of the nitric acid, which is the agent involved. In (b), candidates typically either did very well or scored almost no marks at all. In (i), a number of candidates did not convert to dm<sup><span class="s1">3 </span></sup>and some did not use the average volume in their calculations, again failing to read the question carefully. (c) however was well answered, though some candidates made reference to the ions as charge carriers rather than giving a description of delocalized electrons. Other candidates stated just mobile electrons instead of stating sea of mobile electrons which was required for the mark.</p>

<p class="p1">This question also featured on the G2 forms, as some teachers thought that the inclusion of Aim 8 type questions such as this would disadvantage candidates. However performance by the majority was very good. It should be noted that questions of this type will always be asked in future papers<strong>. </strong>In (a), most candidates correctly identified the boiling points although some reversed the order and a few had B with the highest boiling point. Explanations for this trend were not so well answered. Some candidates referred to breaking bonds in the carbon chain and several answers referred to the length of the carbon chain rather than the degree of branching.</p>

<p class="p1">In c) there were 2 marks for improvements to air quality and 1 mark for a reason.

There were fewer references to oxides of sulfur, although many said that CNG has fewer S impurities rather than to say that less SO<sub><span class="s1">2</span></sub>/SO<sub>x</sub> is released, in this case as they had already scored their explanation mark they could not score for this and ended up with 2 marks out of 3. Some candidates did not centre their answer on what was being asked.
